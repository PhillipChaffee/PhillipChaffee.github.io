## I am looking for a co-founder

[I am working toward starting a venture-backed startup in 2021.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q9Gc1tRD-UkObzmgPby6GLbSkokYjq3XBWeRMR3ARb4/edit?usp=sharing) My current focuses to that end are
  1. Find a co-founder
  2. Decide on a good starting point idea

I am a technical founder looking for another hacker to join me. If you have design or maketing skills that is a huge plus as those are weak spots for me.

**What I am really looking for is a great friend who also wants to start a startup.**
