# 12 Startups Update/Thoughts

- The purpose of 12 projects in 12 months is to find something you want to work on
  - I'm not sure it's beneficial to finish it.
  - If you find something to work on and it doesn't generate revenue, maybe it's back to 12 projects to find another idea.

- Did one more project called Routine
  - Wasn't super happy with it and didn't finish
  - Already had the idea for Open Life halfway through

- OpenLife
  - How I got the idea. Steph/Makerlog/Awesome twitter people/Focusmate
  - Want to build a platform for accountability
  - MVP is goal setting/tracking profile
  - The rough draft is done/ current state
  - Possible future ideas
