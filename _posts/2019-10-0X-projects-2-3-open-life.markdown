# 12 Startups Update/Thoughts

- The purpose of 12 projects in 12 months is to find something you want to work on
  - To start if you don't know where to start
  - I'm not sure it's beneficial to finish it.
  - If you find something to work on and it doesn't generate revenue, maybe it's back to 12 projects to find another idea.

- Did one more project called Routine
  - Wasn't super happy with it and didn't finish
  - Already had the idea for Open Life halfway through

- OpenLife
  - How I got the idea. Steph/Makerlog/Awesome twitter people/Focusmate
  - Want to build a platform for accountability
  - MVP is goal setting/tracking profile
  - The rough draft is done/ current state
  - Possible future ideas

- So what's next?
  - Talk to users about why they signed up
  - Iterate on Open Life
  - I want to write more
  - I will be tracking my goals in Open Life? Maybe?


## Project Status

I started a journey in March to stop telling myself I was going to do something and actually do it. I found a thing multiple others I admired had done called twelve startups in twelve months. It seemed like a great idea to get going so I prepped for a month and started April first.

If you have followed along at all you know I have not put out six projects in the past six months. I have actually done three, but I am very pleased with the results of this venture and I want to tell you why.

The reason I started is because I didn't know what to do at all. I had been telling myself I was going to be an entrepreneur all my life, and now I really had the tools to do it in what I thought would be the best way possible, a tech company. But I wasn't doing anything. I talked about it for two plus years. I got fed up with myself and that led to this.

I don't think I have read a story yet of someone actually finishing twelve projects in twelve months, but I think it would actually be a mistake to do so. The power of the challenge is to get you to do something. It puts you into the world you want to be a part of. Helps you generate ideas. Pushes you in the right direction. I think this is the real purpose of the challenge, and if so it was a success for me.

## Project 2

I posted an update about the first project I completed, GoClimbTo, but I never posted about the second project I did in May. It was called Routine. The idea was a smartphone/smartwatch app to help you learn new routines. When you start a new routine it is very hard to remember all the items in the correct order, so you usually write it down somewhere. The problem there is that you have to go back to the list everytime you complete an item, or carry the list around with you. The app would have routines you wanted to learn, and automatically start them at a given time you specified. The screen of your device would be black with just the text of the first item to complete in your routine. When you complete the task you tap it and the next one appears. I think this could be especially powerful as a smartwatch app.

I started building it in React Native so it would work for all device types. I already knew React after the last project so I figured it couldn't be that hard, but it was! React Native is a whole different beast. The medium of a smartphone is just very different from the web. I ended up only getting as far as implementing the list of tasks for a routine, with the ability to add new ones and mark them as completed or delete them. I still needed to implement multiple routines, routine start time, and the black screen single task UI.

The catch here is that I already had the idea for my next project and I was super jazzed about it. It was something my wife and I both wanted to use and I wanted to build it! I left Routine in the state it was in at the end of May and dove into my next project.

## Open Life

Anna (my lovely wife) and I started to really organize our life in March of this year, which is the main reason I started this! I am so grateful for her influence. I don't think I would be here without her. We started by doing something called the X effect. You draw a seven by seven grid with dates and choose a habit to try to do every day for 49 days straight. If you successfully complete the habit you mark an x on that day otherwise you draw an o. It is a really powerful visual representation of your progress and 49 days cements the new habit into your life.

This led to other positive changes in our life as well. I now have a morning and night routine. We get up early, which I know doesn't work great for everyone but has been huge for me. I get up at 5 and it really helps me be ready to interact with others by the time I get to work and I have way more energy once my body gets used to it. I also started an exercise regimin and our lives are more planned on our calendars than before. It has all been wonderful for our relationship. That all goes to say we are into goal setting and tracking, and I have found that being accountable to another person for the goals you set makes the biggest difference in keeping your goals. I use an app called Focusmate where you work on a video call with another person and it is the best way to work. You have to show up and you are productive because you feel like someone is counting on you. 

I came across Steph Smith's [open page](https://stephsmith.io/open) for her life during my second project and showed it to Anna. We knew we had to have one. I could have just built us each a custom one but I thought there must be other people out there who would want something like this, so I decided to do it for my third project. I started an email list and people started signing up immediately! I was so excited and knew I had hit upon something people were interested in. I couldn't finish an MVP in a month so I decided to keep going with it!

I recently finished that MVP and am excited to be able to share it with you today. It is very rough like a first draft, but I really wanted to release something. I am in [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org) and they always say the first thing to do is launch whatever you can as soon as possible so you can iterate. I think it also provides some accountability to keep going and actually delivering a porduct to your users. So I have lauched a rough MVP and I am excited to get some initial user feedback.

In the future I would like to build Open Life into a full platform for accountability. I want it to be a community of people who push each other to be the best they can be in life. I have a couple ideas for features that could really start to bring that community alive, but for the MVP and the next few releases I am just building out the goal setting and tracking profile.

## What's next?

The beta/MVP is done (in rough form at least). So what's next?

I have a few things planned out before I jump back in to coding. I am going to finish this blog post. I need to write an email letting my subscribers know that the rough MVP is live and they are welcome to play with it and provide feedback. I need to update my welcome email to the mailing list to let new subscribers know they can check out the beta. The main thing I am excited to do is user interviews. I am going to be asking my subscribers if they would like to sit down for a one hour video call to talk about why they joined the list in the first place. I want to know what problems they are trying to solve and get real time feedback on what I have built so far.

After all that it will be time to work on the next iteration of the platform! My current thought is to fix any bugs that are found in the current MVP, make the existing features work better or in more helpful ways, and to make it prettier and customizable.

I will also be writing more. I am going to dedicate a certain number of morning Focusmate sessions to writing, so you will be hearing more from me.

It's been a wild ride these past seven months. I don't think the person I was would recognize who I am today and I am very happy about that. I want to continue that process and build things that help others to do the same. I hope you enjoyed reading. If you have any questions or just want to talk just hit me up on Twitter or Telegram.

Now go have a wonderful day!
