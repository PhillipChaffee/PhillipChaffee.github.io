I like to travel, learn, play table tennis, and find optimal solutions to various problems.

In my time here I want to be able to say I helped/brought people together and never stopped growing as a human being.

If you want to know what I am thinking about, check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.

## Current Goal
Build twelve startups in twelve months. You can read about it <a href="/12startups12months/2019/03/31/just-do-something.html">here</a>.

### Working On
Rock climbing app to share/rate climbs. Name pending!
