Hello, my name is Phillip. 

I am a software engineer living in San Francisco.

I am focusing on starting a venture backed startup in 2021. If I need something else to do I play/study chess, read, and write (sometimes). I hope to add learn piano to that list soon.

I am into self-improvement which I define as constant iteration of [core beliefs](/core-beliefs), [habits](/habits/)/[routine](/routine/), and [goals](/goals/).
